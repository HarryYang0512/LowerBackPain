# Interpretable Machine Learning for Early Detection of Lower Back Pain

## Project Overview

This project was developed as part of a Master’s coursework at **King’s College London**. It aims to design an interpretable machine learning model for early detection and explanation of lower back pain risks using symptom-based data.

The study compares the performance of a **Graph Neural Network (GNN)** with a traditional **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classifier, leveraging a publicly available dataset from Kaggle.

## Objectives

- Build a deep learning model using Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to predict the risk of lower back pain.
- Compare the performance of GNN with the KNN algorithm.
- Provide model interpretability for enhanced understanding of the predictions.
